TableFilter welcomes contributions from anyone and everyone. If you want to get
your hands dirty:

### Pull requests
In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
    - 3.1 **Bump** package version in `package.json` file
    - 3.2. **Add** unit tests covering your change in the `test` folder
    - 3.3. **Run** the tests with the `npm run eslint test` command
    - 3.4. **Ensure** build is working with `npm run dist` command
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
